TODO:
Make the bot do more than generate numbers.
Make the bot post messages depending on the time of day (My TZ) instead of hard-coded intervals.
Make the bot respond to a command - ONLY IF I (Z0F) type the command. //Maybe DM? If not, just check for UID.


DONE BUT NEEDS MORE WORK:
Do more with the randomly generated number.


DONE:
Correctly use VAR, LET, CONST. (Try at least).
Create a testing script. (Make available to GitHub).
Create a TODO file :)
